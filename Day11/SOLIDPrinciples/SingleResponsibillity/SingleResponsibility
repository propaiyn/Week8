Responsibillities are essentially reasons  to change
i.e. class has a single responsibillity, hasa asingle reason to change
If a class has more than one responsibillity or purpose, they should be split into separate classes
Should be broken down so  the classes depend less on eachother and increases the cohesion of the components in that class
