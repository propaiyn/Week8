Structure classes and objects meaningfully (using inheritance and interfaces)
The structural patterns are:
    Flyweight
    Adapter
    Composite
    Decorator
    FaÃ§ade
    Proxy
    Bridge
    Filter

ADAPTER PATTERN

Allows objects with incompatibile interfaces to collaborate
Special object which converts the interface of one object so another object can understand it

FACADE PATTERN

Creating a simplified interface that performs many actions behind the scenes
e.g. 
    can i withdraw 50 pounds?, is account security code valid? are funds avaliable?
    ->>>> make changes accordingly
