Ensures one instance of its kind exists, single point of access globally
             access object from anywhere in app
             e.g. dont want to make a new database instance each time
                  singleton database instance is used throughout program

all implementations of the singleton pattern have 2 common behaviours
    private constructor (prevents other objects using the new operator in the singleton class)
    static creation method that acts as a constructor (method calls the private constructor -> object made->saved under static
    all following calls to this method return the cached object)


One class will only ever make one object

class holds all  potential scrabble letters, and spits out new ones when requested
    each player shares the same potential listof letters
    each player has their own set of letters
